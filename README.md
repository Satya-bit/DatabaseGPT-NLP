# Langchain: Chat with Database 🗄️🤖

Welcome to Langchain: Chat with SQL & Neo4J Database! This Streamlit application allows you to interact with SQL & Neo4J databases using natural language queries powered by Langchain and GROQ's LLM (Language Learning Model). Whether you're using a local SQLite database, connecting to a MySQL database, or querying a Neo4j graph database, this tool makes querying databases as easy as having a conversation.

# 🚀 Features

Natural Language Queries: Ask questions in plain English, and the app will translate them into SQL queries.

Support for Multiple Databases:

SQLite: Use a local SQLite database (student.db).

MySQL: Connect to your MySQL database by providing credentials.

Neo4j: Query Neo4j graph databases for relationship-based data (optional integration).

GROQ API Integration: Leverage the power of GROQ's LLM for intelligent query generation.

Interactive Chat Interface: Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

Clear Chat History: Easily reset the conversation with a single click.

# 🛠️ Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Python 3.10+: Ensure you have Python installed.

GROQ API Key: Sign up for a GROQ API key here.

Databases:

For SQLite: Place your student.db file in the project directory.

For MySQL: Ensure you have the necessary credentials (hostname, username, password, and database name).

For Neo4j: Install Neo4j and set up your database, or use a cloud-based Neo4j instance with the necessary credentials.

# 📝 GROQ API Integration

GROQ is a powerful language model used to generate SQL queries from natural language input. It leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to accurately interpret user queries and translate them into executable SQL statements. This integration makes it easy for users to interact with databases in a conversational manner.

# 🔧 Technologies Used
Langchain: Used to integrate the database and natural language models.

Streamlit: A framework for building the interactive user interface.

GROQ API: A language model designed to generate SQL queries based on user input.

SQLite: A lightweight, local SQL database used for storing data.

MySQL: A widely-used relational database management system (RDBMS) for larger-scale data operations.

Neo4j: A graph database used for handling and querying connected data, ideal for cases where relationships between entities are key (e.g., social networks, recommendation engines).
